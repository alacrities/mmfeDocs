This document describes the current status of the NSW trigger
processor. It documents the specifications, the trigger algorithms
developed and the testing procedures. There are some open issues to be
investigated, including a study of the bandwidth between FPGAs in the
LAr card, the relative mechanical alignment of the BW and NSW and a study of the
expected trigger rates. The choice of the trigger platform hardware, although desirable, is not critical at this point. Studies of hardware/firmware trigger implementation have been hindered by the VMM2 problems.
For simulated data we are dependent on the simulation group.
The Athena simulation of both sTGC and Micromegas triggers is not complete.
The sTGC algorithm studies are especially limited by this absence.
