\subsubsection{Description}
This algorithm has been described in detail in Ref.~\cite{harvardAlg}. Here, its main features are
summarized. The algorithm has four functionally distinct sets of operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item translation of hardware addresses into equivalent track slopes fixed to the IP,
\item determination of the presence of a multi-plane coincidence,
\item parallel calculation of global $\theta$ and local $\theta$ angles with parallel strips and global average stereo strips, using the multi-plane coincidence, 
\item calculation of $\Delta\theta$ and big wheel region of interest. 
\end{enumerate}
The first two items are performed by many {\em finders}, which don't consume significant amount
of resources, but reduce significantly the throughput towards the second half of the algorithm. Items
3 and 4 are performed by {\em fitters} that consume most of the resources allocated to the algorithm,
but only performed upon the presence of a solid track candidate. 
Figure~\ref{fig:harvardAlg} shows the algorithmic flow with smaller functional units. They are labeled
for easy reference when discussing the algorithm implementation.

Blocks after step D are approximately sized to represent their relative processing times.}

\subsubsection{Implementation}\label{sec:harvard_impl}
The algorithm above has been implemented in a Xilinx Vertex 7 FPGA development board with a 320MHz clock constraint and no timing errors. 
Specifically, each of the steps shown in Figure~\ref{fig:harvardAlg} has been implemented as follows. 

\begin{enumerate}%[(A)]
\item[(A)] Incoming strip hit addresses are converted to global slope values using a look-up table. A strip's stored slope value is 
defined as the orthogonal distance between a given strip and the beam line divided by the $z$ location of the relevant detection 
plane. It is precomputed taking into account a strip offset and a $z$ position stored for each of the 8 planes and 
16 radial segments of each wedge (one segment is read-out per MMFE8).  
\item[(B)] Hit slope values are stored in a circular buffer defined as $(N$~slope-roads$)\times(8$~planes$)\times(T)$, where $T$ is the cyclical buffer depth and corresponds to the number of bunch crossings over which coincidences between planes are allowed.  A track candidate is identified once a minimum hit threshold is met. The value of $N$ has been optimized to maximize efficiency while being resilient to backgrounds\cite{harvardAlg}, and corresponds to about 4 (56) strips per slope road for horizontal (stereo) strips. 
\item[(C)] Each slope-road of the buffer is checked once per bunch crossing to determine if a coincidence threshold has been met. 
Coincidence requires a minimum number of planes to be hit and the oldest piece of data to be timing out. Coincidence identification is accomplished using the binary hit configuration for a given slope-road as the address of a lookup table that is pre-populated with pass or no-pass signals for various hit configurations of the eight planes.  Rather than searching the entire buffer for hits, only active areas are interrogated for confidence verification. 
\item[(D)] slope-road contents containing the track candidate are read and cleared from the buffer and relevant track components are forwarded for processing. \\ 

Once a candidate track is identified, the following steps (E-I) are completed in parallel: \\

\item[(E)] A local slope is calculated using a least squares fit of available horizontal-strip hits in the proposed track.  
Several constants are stored in a look-up table for the 11 possible combinations (indexed by $k=\{1..11\}$) of $n=\{2,3,4\}$ 
horizontal hits to speed up the fit. 
\item[(F)] A global horizontal hit slope, which is anchored to the IP, is calculated as the average of registered $n=\{2,3,4\}$ horizontal-strip hits in the proposed track candidate.  
\item[(G)] A global stereo (U) hit slope, which is anchored to the IP, is calculated as the average of registered $n=\{1,2\}$ U hits in the proposed track candidate.  
\item[(H)] A global stereo (V) hit slope, which is anchored to the IP, is calculated as the average of registered $n=\{1,2\}$ U hits in the proposed track candidate.  
\item[(I)] Stereo-strip background hits are further filtered from proposed tracks by judging how correlated two stereo-strip hits are with one another. In particular, strips with the same stereo tilt are compared between the two multiplets. If they are consistent between
the two multiplets, the pair is kept, while otherwise it is discarded. If only one multiplet registers a hit on a strip of a given stereo tilt, it is kept. 
\item[(J)] $\Delta\theta$ is calculated using previously fitted local and global horizontal slopes ($M_X^{\rm local}$ and $M_X^{\rm global}$).  
This calculation is accomplished using a small $\phi$ angle approximation. In local coordinates, for which $\phi=0$ at the middle 
of the module, this approximation introduces at most a 4\% bias in the $\Delta\theta$ calculation. 
In order to speed up the calculation, the quantity $1/(1+M_X^{\rm local}M_X^{\rm global})$ is calculated using a reciprocal 
look-up table
that introduces a negligible error. Tracks with negative local slopes (originating from outside the detector) are rejected at this step. 
Candidates with $\Delta\theta>20$~mrad are also rejected at this step. 
\item[(K)] A Region of Interest (ROI) is determined using previously calculated stereo and horizontal slopes. In particular, if hits 
exist for both stereo tilts, the cartesian position along the horizontal strip direction is calculated using the two
stereo hit slopes (U and V). If only one exists, the intersection point of the stereo strip and the horizontal strip is
calculated. This requires the storage of two quantities: $A\equiv\csc(1.5^{\circ})$ and $B\equiv\cot(1.5^{\circ})$, two products
and an addition. The horizontal slope provides the other cartesian coordinate. The two cartesian coordinates are transformed
into an ROI using a look-up table. If the two cartesian coordinates do not correspond to an ROI in the wedge (which can happen in 
cases with significant background contamination), the candidate is rejected. 
\item[(L)] A $\Delta\theta$ and ROI are offered as a trigger signal.

\end{enumerate}

Timing estimates for these steps have been performed using the evaluation board described at the beginning of this
section.  The trigger algorithm's longest path is $\approx$37~ns, assuming all necessary hits arrive promptly and track fitting 
begins immediately.  However, the algorithm implements a 50~ns waiting period for hits to accumulate before beginning track 
fitting operations.  Once this accumulation period expires, the algorithm requires a maximum of 9 clock ticks, 
or  $\approx$28~ns, to determine if a coincidence threshold has been satisfied, the $\Delta\theta$ and the ROI. 
The 28~ns fitting time is set; however, the remaining prior steps can be included in the 50~ns hit accumulation time window.
Therefore, the entire latency time is approximately three bunch crossings. 

\subsubsection{Misalignment Configurations and Corrections}
The performance in Section~\ref{sec:harv-perf} is evaluated for ideal conditions and for
samples simulated with several misalignment effects. This section describes
the types of misalignment effects considered, how they are simulated and the
implementation of misalignment corrections in the FPGA algorithm. All misalignments
considered refer to misalignments of one multiplet with respect to the other in
the same sector. Misalignments affecting the full sector are not addressed, because they
only affect the ROI finding, which requires less precision. However, similar correction
techniques as those explored here can be applied to full sector position inaccuracies. 

The following misalignment configurations are considered: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $r$, displacements orthogonal to the beam axis---one or part of a multiplet shifted up or down with respect to the other,  
\item $\phi$, rotations along an axis perpendicular to the wedge of one multiplet with respect to the other, with the axis
going through the center of the lower edge of the chamber, 
\item $\theta_{\rm tilt}$, one plane tilted towards the IP with respect to the other,
\item $z$, one multiplet displaced along the beam axis. 
\end{enumerate}
Figure~\ref{fig:harvard_misal_illustration} illustrates each of these cases. Figures~\ref{fig:harvard_misal_illustration}~(a) 
and~(b) correspond to two cases of the first misalignment type considered above.

	as it would look from the IP. 
	}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

These misalignments are simulated through the use of true hits in the Athena simulation. 
The true hit position that causes the trigger to fire is known. It is thus trivial to overlay a 
misaligned geometry over the true hits and recalculate the strips that were hit. Misalignments
corresponding to up to 5~mm shifts in the relative positions of the two wedges are considered. 
For the $\phi$ rotations and the $\theta_{\rm tilt}$ this corresponds to up to $1.36$~mrad.  

The performance of the trigger algorithm is studied with and without misalignments. In addition, 
corrections have been implemented for all cases illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:harvard_misal_illustration} 
except case (c). The implementation of the corrections happens in steps~A and~E of the algorithm, described
in Section~\ref{sec:harvard_impl}, without any additional resource overhead. 
In particular, as already detailed, $2\times 8\times 16$ constants, corresponding
to 8 planes and 16 MMFEs, store the radial offset and $z$ position of the corresponding strips. These constants
can be updated to perfectly counteract the effects of the cases illustrated above in (a), (b) and (e). Case
(d) can also be corrected with some loss of accuracy, since only 16 $z$ positions are stored along the tilted 
plane. The $z$ positions stored can be optimized, but for the studies in this document the middle $z$ position 
of the strips read out by each MMFE is used. The loss of accuracy from this simplified corrections is quantified 
in the next section. Corrections for case (c) have not been studied yet, but the effects of such a misalignment
have been studied and are shown in the next section.  

\subsubsection{Performance}\label{sec:harv-perf}
The performance of the algorithm is studied using single muon events generated with Athena 
full simulation. A geometry with two equal quadruplets each with two horizontal strips and two
different-tilt stereo strips (xxuv) was used. Most of the studies used here use a geometry 
in which the quadruplets are placed with horizontal strips placed closer to the IP 
(xxuv xxuv). 

The samples generated use typical parameters of the ATLAS beamspot during Run~1 
using for the origin of the muons Gaussian distributions of mean $(x,y,z)=(0.05,0.06,-1)$~mm 
and $(\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z)=(0.01,0.01,70)$~mm. Three samples using 
muons with energies of 50, 200 and 1000~\GeV have been studied. Each sample has 20000 events
with muons pointing to one large sector of the NSW. 
Of the digitized hits found in the simulation, the first
registered signal per channel was chosen for trigger construction.  
A function mimicking a VMM chip's 100~ns deadtime and coverage of 
64 strips was also applied to the data.  This function serves to guarantee a 
maximum of one hit, true or background, is registered for each 64 grouping of strips for each event.

Three set of studies complement the performance studies in ideal conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item a study of the effects of incoherent background, 
\item a study of the impact of misalignments and the corrections designed to mitigate them,
\item a study of the performance with quadruplets with mirror-image placement (xxuv uvxx), proposed recently
to increase the lever-arm for fitting the bending coordinate using horizontal (x) strips. 
\end{itemize}

The following variables are used to parameterize performance. Fit efficiency is defined as the efficiency 
for a track to trigger the detector given that a minimum number of trigger hits before including background exist. 
In particular, n-horizontal/n-stereo refers to events for which there were at least n hits in the horizontal strips and 
the same amount in the stereo strips before addition of background hits. Distributions are calculated with respect
to truth definitions. In particular, the distributions of $\theta^{\rm{fit}}-\theta^{\rm{true}}$, 
$\phi^{\rm{fit}}-\phi^{\rm{true}}$, and $\Delta\theta^{\rm{fit}}-\Delta\theta^{\rm{true}}$, for which true coordinates and direction
are defined at the entrance of the NSW, are studied. The distributions are fit using Gaussian fits with a one-step recursive
fit. The raw results are first fitted to a gaussian. The quoted resolutions are obtained through a fit in the range 
$[\mu_1-3\sigma_1,\mu_1+3\sigma_1]$, where $\mu_1$ and $\sigma_1$ are the mean and standard deviation of the first fit. Tails
are defined as the fraction of events outside the range $[\mu_1-3\sigma_1,\mu_1+3\sigma_1]$. 

Sample distributions, integrated over all $\eta$, are shown for the $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\Delta\theta$ reconstruction
in Figures~\ref{fig:phi_harvard}, \ref{fig:theta_harvard} and \ref{fig:dtheta_harvard}.

The distributions do not change significantly with energy, except for an increase in the tails for the highest
energy studied. This is caused by an increase in events with large number of secondary particles, 
which throw off the fit when they occur. 

The $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\Delta\theta$ resolutions for the ideal geometry for $E=200\GeV$ muons 
without backgrounds, obtained from a fit are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:efficiencyHarvardIdeal}. 
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Efficiency and resolution (mrad) for different coincidence thresholds without background.
\label{tab:efficiencyHarvardIdeal}  }
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l c c c c}

\hline \hline
4-horizontal/4-stereo & 100.0\% & 0.27 (0.83\%) & 2.5 (1.5\%) & 1.5 (0.65\%) \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The impact of backgrounds is studied in the geometry with perfect alignment. 
Incoherent background extrapolated from measurements performed in Run~1\cite{CERN-LHCC-2011-012} 
is added outside of Athena to each generated event as hits after 
the digitization step.  Background hits are uniformly distributed in $\phi$, and in time across two bunch 
crossings (50~ns).  Once generated for each event, the background hits are combined with true event hits and a VMM-mimicking 
function is called by the simulation to choose only the earliest arrival hit for each VMM chip, which allows for the background to 
sometimes mask a true trigger hit. 

The $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\Delta\theta$ resolutions for the ideal geometry for $E=200\GeV$ muons 
without backgrounds are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:efficiencyHarvardBkg}. 
\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{table}

For the misalignments studied in this section, no changes in efficiency have been
observed. However, a degradation in the resolution of the $\Delta\theta$ reconstruction,
as well as $\theta$ and $\phi$, has been observed. For brevity, only the results for the
$\Delta\theta$ reconstruction are shown here, since $\theta$ and $\phi$ reconstruction
only impacts the ROI choice, which is much coarser than the resolution achieved by
the trigger, shown earlier in this section. 

Figure~\ref{fig:harvard_misal_effect} shows the relative change in $\Delta\theta$ resolution as a function of misalignment
for the different misalignment configurations illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:harvard_misal_illustration}.

\end{figure}
The degradation shows a certain periodicity related to strip width for displacements. This is clear for 
Figures~\ref{fig:harvard_misal_effect}~(a) and~(b). The degradation is higher when only half of the
detector is radially shifted (b) because a double peak structure is formed, which increases more significantly
the peak width. Rotations (c and d) cause monotonic changes in performance. The degradation is more 
significant when the tilt is away from the IP (positive axis) because more strips are forced to cover the same
solid angle, increasing the effective distance between the strip that should have been hit and the strip that 
is actually hit. Figure~\ref{fig:harvard_misal_effect}~(e) first shows first a fixed level of degradation, again
caused by a discrete strip width. At around 1~mm a two-peak structure appears in the distribution, which causes
an increase in the RMS. As the distribution gets further smeared the double peak structure disappears, yielding
a monotonically increasing degradation. 

It should be noted that corrections for all cases, except (c) have been developed. Based on this, a degradation
of up to 25\% on $\Delta\theta$ resolution (or from 1.7~mrad to 2.1~mrad in the 4-horizontal/4-stereo case) is 
expected for 5~mm misalignments. 

Recently, the possibility of building sectors with the mirror-image placement (resulting
in a xxuv uvxx horizontal/stereo strip configuration) has been opened. From the perspective of
the trigger, new simulations have not been produced yet. However, estimates of the improvement
in the $\Delta\theta$ resolution have been obtained. 

The estimate has been performed using a 
toy simulation of the trigger algorithm, which does not include any ionization or scattering effects. 
This simulation only demonstrates resolution effects arising from the width of the strips. Based 
on this simulation, a $\Delta\theta$ resolution of 0.89~mrad has been estimated for the 
4-horizontal/4-stereo hit category in the standard geometry. This number can be used together
with the resolution obtained in the full simulation (and shown in Table~\ref{tab:efficiencyHarvardIdeal}) 
to estimate the impact of different physics effects (ionization, multiple scattering...) 
in the resolution. In particular, using $\sigma_{\rm athena}^2=\sigma_{\rm physics}^2+\sigma_{\rm geometry}^2$,
one can estimate $\sigma_{\rm physics}$. The toy simulation can then be used to calculate the new
$\sigma^{\rm new}_{\rm geometry}$ for the mirror-image geometry. This, combined with $\sigma_{\rm physics}$
provides the estimate of the quantity of interest $\sigma^{\rm new}_{\rm athena}$. Using this procedure, 
one estimates that with the new geometry the ideal $\Delta\theta$ resolution for the 4-horizontal/4-stereo
hit category improves to 1.4~mrad from 1.5~mrad, or less than 10\%.
