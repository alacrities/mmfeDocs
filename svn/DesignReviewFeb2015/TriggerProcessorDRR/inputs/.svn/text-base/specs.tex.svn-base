The context diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:TrigProcContext} shows the different interfaces to the NSW Trigger Processor
and the signal flow through the trigger system.
The NSW Trigger Processor is implemented in FPGAs on mezzanine cards of an ATCA carrier card.
One NSW sector (16~per end-cap wheel) is implemented on one FPGA (Xilinx Virtex~7 XC7VX690T).
Input and output fibers connect directly to the mezzanine cards.
Some services are on the carrier card which has an Ethernet connection.
The plan for the fiber connections from the front ends to the readout and trigger processors in USA-15 is shown in Appendix~\ref{app:specs-fibers}.

%Should the Trigger Processor FPGA become excessively utilized for the trigger algorithms,
%it is possible to move some of the non-algorithm logic to the FPGA on the carrier board.


\subsection{Trigger Processor Latency}
\label{sec:latency}

The trigger signal delivery time to the MuCTPI has to happen within 57~Bunch Crossings (BCs) (an increase of 3.5~BCs from the \PhaseZero system).
The New Sector Logic requires 16~BCs from the time it receives the trigger signal from the NSW and BW until it delivers it to the MuCTPI (5 BCs for serializer/deserializer,
9~BCs for trigger processing, and 2~BCs for transmission via fiber).
This leaves 43~BCs (1075~ns) for the full NSW trigger processing chain (including 2~BCs to merge the MM and sTGC trigger streams and time for the signal transmission to the Sector Logic).

The latency of the current design of the NSW trigger chain is at the
boundary of the required value, leaving no contingency.
It is therefore imperative to keep the latency as low as possible at
every step of the chain, including at the Trigger Processor.
The TP latency estimation is given in Table\,\ref{tab:latency} for both chamber technologies.
The accounting includes the input/output serializers, the trigger algorithm, the transmission time to the Sector Logic,
and the algorithm that merges the \MM and \stgc streams. The merging is currently planned to occur in the \stgc FPGA.
