The testing of the trigger processor and algorithm
implementation in hardware, for both \MM and sTGC, will be
performed in four ways. Initially, signals from upstream electronics
are generated in the trigger processor FPGA and looped back in
order to test the implementation of the algorithm in hardware. Testing of the full
electronics chain requires further work. In
the absence of realistic chambers, the
detector and front-end output will be emulated by pattern generators
in order to characterize the full trigger chain, including
the ADDC. Additionally, the trigger
system will be tested on real detectors with cosmic rays and in a
test beam.
