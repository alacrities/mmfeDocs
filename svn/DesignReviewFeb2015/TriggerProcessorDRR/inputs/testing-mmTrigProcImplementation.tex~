\subsubsection{Trigger Processor Initial Testing}

A 1/16\textsuperscript{th} slice of the complete Trigger Processor
design has been implemented and is being tested using a Xilinx VC707
Development board. This board includes a Virtex XC7VX485T-2FFG1761C
FPGA. The implementation includes 2 ADDC GBT interfaces and associated
trigger processor algorithm. 

To exercise the trigger processor design we have developed an ADDC
emulator. This design can be used to supply properly formatted ADDC
GBT packets through an optical transmitter as sent from an actual
ADDC. The same ART data used for simulations is being used for hardware
testing. We are also generating pseudo random ART data to test the
GBT communication and timing of packet decoder.

To evaluate the hardware implementation, we compare the hardware results
with results generated using a computer simulation. All of the differences
at this point are due to the number of significant bits being used
in the hardware implementation. We are currently working on optimizing
this. Figure~\ref{fig:hardwareTestingInitial} show an example of such comparisons by looking at the
differences between hardware implementation and software simulation
ROI result. in this example, the x and y axis represent the percent
error of the ROI Cartesian coordinates.

We have begun integration testing with the BNL ADDC and have successfully
transmitted data to the trigger processor using the ADDC's VTRx ASIC.
