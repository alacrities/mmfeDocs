Setting up a new ATLAS note or paper.
See ChangeLog or SVN log for history of changes.

Responsible: Ian Brock (Ian.Brock@cern.ch)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can create a new ATLAS document by using the command:
make new BASENAME=mydocument
where mydocument is the name of the main file of the document.

This just executes the following commands:
cp template/atlas-document.tex mydocument.tex
touch mydocument-defs.sty
touch mydocument.bib
It will also copy the following files:
template/atlas-document-metadata.tex   to mydocument-metadata.tex
template/atlas-document-contribute.tex to mydocument-contribute.tex

Other useful files in the template directory:
atlas-detector.tex				some example ATLAS detector descriptions
atlas-document-metadata.tex		contains the document title, abstract and labels 
								associated with the document
atlas-document-contribute.tex 	provides an environment to list the contributors 
								to an analysis

Cover pages
-----------

atlas-draft-cover.tex is a template for a standalone ATLAS draft cover,
which is needed when your paper, CONF, PUB note draft is circulated to the collaboration.
This file is only needed if you cannot use the atlascover package directly in your document.

atlas-preprint-cover.tex creates the first page of a CERN preprint. Again this is only needed if for some reason you cannot use the atlascover package directory in your document.

Note that it is preferable to input the file mydocument-metadata.tex in these files
rather than copying all the definitions from there (or your main document) into these files.
