ADDC ART Data Format
  sent as GBT packet 
  hit-list format

Verticle slice implemented with no timing errors using -2 speedgrade
  show 1/16th slice implementation results
  extrapolated resource useage ~70% in "485" part
  expected part and resource useage

slice of Algorithim is fully functional 
Implementation is scaliable with setable parameters


Integration with ADDC

Ancellary functions

Currently working on optimizing signal bit precision 
Do I say anything about the bit precision?
ADDC algorithim format will require 8 optical links!
