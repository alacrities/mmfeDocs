System Overview
  Show MM to Sector Logic full chain including FELIX <block diagram>

ART Data Input
  MMFE8 > ADDC > Trigger Processor <block Diagram of 1 ADDC ASIC>

ADDC ART Data Format
  sent as GBT packet 
  hit-list format

Block diagram of FPGA 
  GBT-FPGA firmware
  GBT Decoder
  Algorithm 
  Track Canidate to sTGC FPGA

Block Diagram of Algorithm
  Finder -track canidate

Verticle slice implemented with no timing errors using -2 speedgrade
  show 1/16th slice implementation results
  extrapolated resource useage ~70% in "485" part
  expected part and resource useage

Development Board Testing
  Xilinx VC707 (xc7 485 -2)

Internal Loopback test mode
  block diagram daq including matlab code

GBT fiber loopback mode

slice of Algorithim is fully functional 
Implementation is scaliable with setable parameters


Integration with ADDC

Ancellary functions

Currently working on optimizing signal bit precision 
Do I say anything about the bit precision?
ADDC algorithim format will require 8 optical links!
